## Bonus: Reducing Tight Coupling

1. Use Interfaces: using interfaces reduces direct dependencies on concrete classes.
2. Event Delegation: Utilize events to notify other parts of the application when actions occur instead of directly calling methods on other classes.
3. Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (interfaces).
